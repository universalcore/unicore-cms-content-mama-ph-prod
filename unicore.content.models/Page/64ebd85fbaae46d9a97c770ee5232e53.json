Eating lots of different coloured fruit and vegetables will give you lots of goodness.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tStarchy, filling foods, such as rice and potatoes. Base your meals around starchy foods. This will give you plenty of energy.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tProtein-rich foods, such as tofu, eggs, fish, poultry and meat. These foods are also good sources of iron. They will help you to stay strong.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCalcium-rich foods such as soy milk, coconut milk and tofu. \r\n\r\nAdding iodised salt to your food will give you iodine. You need plenty of iodine in your diet to help your baby's brain to develop. If salt is iodised, it will say this on the packet. Try to have some every day.\r\n\r\nBy eating a range of these foods you will be able to stay fit and strong, as well as grow a healthy baby.\r\n",
