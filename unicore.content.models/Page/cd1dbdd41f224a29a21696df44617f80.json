  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nEven if you've never felt breathless before, like lots of women, you may sometimes feel breathless now. This is normal. Your body is adapting, and growing a baby!\r\n\r\nYou can help your breathing by keeping away from dirty air and smoky places.\r\n\r\nDo you smoke? Stop, or cut down now. It is bad for health. Remember, you can save the money you spend on smoking to buy things you will need during pregnancy and for the baby.\r\n\r\nTry to stay away from people who are smoking. Smoking and breathing in other people\u2019s smoke is harmful for you and your baby. Ask your family to smoke outside.\r\n\r\nIf your house is smoky, open doors and windows. You can reduce smoke when you cook:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse LPG, electricity, or a kerosene cooker if possible.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse a lid. The pot can conserve heat and you can reduce cooking time, and so breathe in less smoke.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSoak food before cooking to reduce cooking time.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tVacuuming or mopping can reduce the amount of dust you breathe in.\r\n\r\nIf you are breathless all the time, you may be anaemic. This means your body lacks iron. Taking iron tablets will help. You can get them free from your midwife, nurse or doctor.\r\n\r\nYou can also make sure you eat a variety of different foods like dark leafy vegetables, eggs, fruit, fish, meat, poultry and tofu. They all help your body to get iron.\r\n",
